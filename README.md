## 🐾 Animal Adoption App – Frontend

The Animal Adoption App is a React-based frontend application designed to connect people with animals in need of adoption. It provides an intuitive interface where users can browse available animals, view detailed profiles, sign up or log in using secure JWT authentication, submit adoption requests, and make donations. Administrators have additional access to manage animal listings and user activity. Built with technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and React Router, and connected to a Flask backend, the app ensures smooth data management and user interaction. The project also supports image uploads, toast notifications, and a responsive design for a better user experience.

- First running the frontend by `cd Frontend/Adoption` then run the following inside the frontend directory
