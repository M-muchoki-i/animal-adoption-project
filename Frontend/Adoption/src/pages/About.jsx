      <p className="mb-4">
        At the Animal Adoption Center, we believe every animal deserves a loving
        home. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome animals in
        need, providing them with a second chance at life.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We work closely with local shelters, veterinary clinics, and volunteers
        to ensure our animals receive the best care possible. Whether you’re
        looking to adopt a new friend, donate, or get involved in our rescue
        community, we’re here to help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for supporting our mission. Together, we can make a difference
        — one paw at a time. 🐾
